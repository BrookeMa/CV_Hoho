### Electronic blackboard remote control
The link to the electronic blackboard is paired by Bluetooth in addition to code scanning, Because the contents of the remote control were not recorded at that time, the demonstration could not continue, which included video projection, electronic blackboard content synchronization,PPT display, video courseware sharing, video recording and other functions
